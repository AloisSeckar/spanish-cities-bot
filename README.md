# spanish-cities-bot

This project helps to fill [spanish-cities](https://github.com/ByMykel/spanish-cities) with data.

It takes `json` crawled by [wiki-image-crawler](https://github.com/AloisSeckar/wiki-image-crawler) and tries to apply it on `cities.json` file from [spanish-cities](https://github.com/ByMykel/spanish-cities).
